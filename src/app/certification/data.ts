    q: "Can I start printing the ISI mark before the licence arrives?",
    a: "No. Applying the Standard Mark without a valid licence is a punishable offence under the BIS Act, 2016. Marking may begin only after the licence is granted — and must stop immediately if it is suspended or cancelled.",
  },
  {
    q: "What concessions do MSMEs get?",
    a: "Micro units and recognized startups can receive concessions of up to 80% on certification, testing and marking fees; small-scale units around 50%; women entrepreneurs and units in the North-East get additional relief. Claim them by attaching the Udyam/startup certificate with the application.",

  {
    q: "Do imported electronics need a factory audit in India?",
    a: "No — CRS does not involve an up-front factory audit. The model is tested in a BIS-recognized lab and registered online with an R-number. The brand owner (or its authorised representative) holds the registration and is answerable for surveillance.",
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if a market sample fails?",
    a: "BIS can suspend or cancel the licence, stop production and recall stock. For CRS, the model's registration is cancelled and imports of that model are blocked. Restoring the licence needs corrective action, fresh testing and often an audit.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the test report from any lab accepted?",
    a: "Only from labs recognized by BIS for that specific Indian Standard. Before testing, confirm the lab appears in the recognized list for your IS code — a report from an unlisted lab wastes both money and the report's short validity window.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do I verify a licence or a HUID as a consumer?",
    a: "Use the BIS Care app or the BIS licence/HUID search with the CM/L- or R- number printed on the product (or the six-character HUID on jewellery). Pramaan's Consumer page also accepts these numbers against its demo registry.",
